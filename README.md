# HealSpace OS @ Github Cloud
### Launch the Cloud Operating System <a href="https://healspaceos-wgl.pages.dev">here (for Phone)</a>
#### HealSpace OS is the first Cloud Operating System that focused for people with ilness.

I personally use this OS during my journey through cancer, and it personally helps me a lot. I might be long gone when you read this page, but my esoteric presence will be with you through the esoteric portal of this OS.

This OS focuses on :
- Energy Healing with Humming Mantra
- Reducing Anxiety with Clean Minimalist Monochrome Interface
- Emiting Reiki Energy through Esoteric Portal

I hope this OS can help you get better, or at least assisting you while preparing for the inevitable.
