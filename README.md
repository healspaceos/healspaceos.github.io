# HealSpace OS @ Github Cloud
### Launch the Cloud Operating System <a href="https://healspaceos-wgl.pages.dev">here (for Phone)</a>
#### HealSpace OS is the first Cloud Operating System dedicated to people with illness.

I personally used this OS during my journey through cancer, and it helped me immensely. I might be long gone when you read this page, but my esoteric presence will remains with you through the esoteric portal of this OS.

This OS focuses on:
- Energy Healing with Humming Mantra
- Reducing Anxiety with a Clean Minimalist Monochrome Interface
- Emitting Reiki Energy through the Esoteric Portal (24/7)
- Helping Build Mindful Habits

I hope this OS can help you get better, or at least assist you in preparing for the inevitable.
