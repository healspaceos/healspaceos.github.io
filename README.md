# HealSpace OS @ GitHub Cloud
<div><img src="healspace-os-mockup.png"></div>

### Launch the Cloud Operating System <a href="https://healspaceos.github.io/HOSWebGL/">here (for Phone)</a>
#### HealSpace OS is the first Cloud Operating System dedicated to people with illness.

I personally used this OS during my journey through cancer, and it helped me immensely. I might be long gone when you read this page, but my esoteric presence will remain with you through the esoteric portal of this OS.

This OS focuses on:
- Aligning Energy with Humming Mantra
- Reducing Anxiety with Practical Breathwork
- Emitting Reiki Energy through the Esoteric Portal (24/7)
- Helping Build Mindful Habits

I hope this OS can help you get better, or at least assist you in preparing for the inevitable.

I chose to host this website and OS on GitHub to ensure its long-term preservation. As I may no longer be around to handle periodic domain and hosting renewals, this platform ensures that HealSpace OS remains accessible even in my absence.
